      <h1>What's the Big Idea?</h1>
      <div>
        <p>For quite some time, I have wanted to make a website for myself. I gathered a lot of great ideas from my contributions to the <a href="https://www.augustana.net/webguild">Augustana Web Guild</a>, where I designed websites for dozens of local clients, but a frequent obstacle I would run into is a lack of content to upload. Fast forward a couple of years, and I happen to have some time on my hands and a couple of really interesting projects I would like to share with the world.</p>
      </div>
      <h1>What's Next?</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Most of my current projects come from my work at Illinois, but there are a couple of ideas I have for some cool projects I would like to complete on the side. Some of these ideas include a multifunctional wall clock, an FPGA arcade game, and a backpack with lots of sensors, to give some examples. Of course, I would like to make note of my projects on this website and leave some breadcrumbs behind so others can gain inspiration for personal projects of their own.</p>
        <p>Considering other content to add to the website later, I might follow an example from <a href="https://whitehoodhacker.net">Minh Duong's home page</a> and list some certs and experiences I pick up along the way. I think this layout is pretty intuitive and a nice way to keep track of all the cool stuff he's done over the years, and I would like to do something similar. I'm also a fan of the creative direction on <a href="https://whambamleo.github.io/leoulgezu-xp/">Leoul Gezu's website</a>, and I think the way he structures his experiences and skills is very straightforward and easy to understand.</p>
      </div>
      <h1>What About Those Pictures?</h1>
      <div>
        <p>I did promise to have some cool pictures on this page. On my landing page, I have a little JS script that rotates through some of my more impressive shots from my adventures around the world. I'll put some of them on this page and provide some context about where they are from. Click on each picture to view it in full resolution.</p>

      <div class="image-left">
        <a href="assets/img/header-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/header-1-small.jpg" alt="Picture of a Cliff Face from Utah"></a>
        <p>This picture comes from I-70 in Utah on the drive back from my internship in Santa Clara, California. I was passing through some really cool cliff faces and got a couple of pictures; I thought this was one of the better ones.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-right">
        <a href="assets/img/header-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/header-2-small.jpg" alt="Evening picture of the Southern Ocean"></a>
        <p>This picture comes from the Southern Ocean, near some of the outlying islands from the Antarctic Peninsula. When traveling in extreme latitudes during the summertime, the sun stays up for most of the day (if not the entire day!) and can produce sunsets that last for hours at a time, creating very photogenic scenes like this one.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-left">
        <a href="assets/img/header-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/header-3-small.jpg" alt="Picture of Antarctic Mountains"></a>
        <p>This picture comes from one of the many mountain ranges in the Antarctic Peninsula. To me, this image almost seems like it's coming out of a storybook, with clouds surrounding snow-capped mountains on the ocean's edge. These mountains are huge, too - this picture was taken from a boat, so the scale might be a little misleading!</p>
