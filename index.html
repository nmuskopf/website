        <p>I'm Nick, an aspiring security professional and recent graduate of computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This website is my portfolio, a place where I can show others my projects and hobby work.</p>
        <p>Over time, this website will grow and change. Right now there's not much going on here, but I would like to put my cool projects and hobby work here soon. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a recent computer engineering graduate from the <a href="https://www.illinois.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. Before that, I developed an interest for computer science and engineering in my studies at <a href="https:/www.augustana.edu">Augustana College</a>, where I studied engineering physics before transferring to Illinois. Over the next couple of years, I took courses in algorithms and computer architecture and developed an interest in cybersecurity. A significant portion of my interest comes from my involvement in <a href="https://sigpwny.com">SIGPwny</a>, the UIUC cybersecurity student interest group, and <a href="https://spri.engr.illinois.edu">SPR@I</a>, the Security & Privacy research group at Illinois.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I enjoy designing websites; I was part of the <a href="https://www.augustana.net/webguild">Augustana Web Guild</a> while I was I was studying at Augustana College and worked on plenty of websites for local clients. While I don't do as much website design work as I used to, I love bringing content, design, and usability together in one package. I began participating in CTFs once I joined SIGPwny, and I also dabble in photography every once in a while. Check out my <a href="hello-world.html">Hello World article</a> to see some of my favorite shots!</p>

        <h2>Chip Defense: The Secure Boot Project</h2>
        <p>In my experience dabbling with development boards, one area that I wish more developers touched on was the principle of <i>Secure Boot</i>. By securing IoT devices at the root of execution, we can introduce some peace of mind when it comes to cyberattacks.</p>
