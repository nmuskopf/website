        <p>I'm Nick, an aspiring security professional and computer engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This website is my portfolio, a place where I can show others my projects and hobby work.</p>
        <p>Over time, this website will grow and change. Right now there's not much going on here, but I would like to put my cool projects and hobby work here soon. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a college student studying computer engineering at the <a href="https://www.illinois.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. Before that, I developed an interest for computer science and engineering in my studies at <a href="https:/www.augustana.edu">Augustana College</a>, where I studied engineering physics before transferring to Illinois. Over the next couple of years, I took courses in algorithms and computer architecture and developed an interest in cybersecurity. A significant portion of my interest comes from my involvement in <a href="https://sigpwny.com">SIGPwny</a>, the UIUC cybersecurity student interest group, and <a href="https://spri.engr.illinois.edu">SPR@I</a>, the Security & Privacy research group at Illinois.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I enjoy designing websites; I was part of the <a href="https://www.augustana.net/webguild">Augustana Web Guild</a> while I was I was studying at Augustana College and worked on plenty of websites for local clients. While I don't do as much website design work as I used to, I love bringing content, design, and usability together in one package. I began participating in CTFs once I joined SIGPwny, and I also dabble in photography every once in a while. Eventually I will put some of my favorite shots on this website, so check back soon!</p>
        <p>While I am still finishing my studies, I am an aspiring security professional currently looking for employment. I am constantly growing my portfolio, and I am excited for what's coming next.</p>

        <h2>Linux-like Operating System</h2>
        <p>I led a team of three to create an operating system using x86 machine language and C that could simulate a Unix command prompt with considerable accuracy and speed. This was been one of the most time-intensive projects I have ever worked on, but an important stepping stone in terms of the work I want to do in industry.</p>
